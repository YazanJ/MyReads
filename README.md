# React Nanodegree Project - MyReads
Need a place to keep track of your evergrowing book obsession? Dream of a beautiful space to neatly store all the books you've read, are currently reading, and want-to-read?

Look no further â€” this is the app for you!

There is a search feature that allows you to seamlessly add new books to your personal library.

## DEMO

## Installation
To begin using the app, clone the project and enter the following commands:

```bash
npm install 
npm start
```

## Backend Server

To simplify the development process, Udacity has provided a backend server as well as a client file ``` BooksAPI.js ``` that contains the functions needed to interact with the server. 

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
